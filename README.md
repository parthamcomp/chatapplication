# Chat Application

This is a very simple chat application using Node.js and socket.io. This project was inspired by the tutorials by Web Dev Simplified (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxzOqP9YwmM and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UymGJnv-WsE).
This application allows multiple clients to connect to the chat server and exchange messages with each other on the same chat window.
